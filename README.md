# Smart Attach (Visual Studio Extension)

A visual studio extension which replaces the standard ***Attach to Process*** dialog of Visual Studio (***ctrl + alt + p***) into a more useful one.

[TODO: Add picture here]

- It will list only the .NET processes
- For ASP.NET processes, it will show the name of the website
- It will automatically try to pre-select the process it thinks you're likely to want to debug (based on the open VS solution)
